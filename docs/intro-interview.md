name, place, job description, experience, project, hobbies. 

Hello, my name is Ashish Bindra and you can address me Ashish. I hail from Patiala. I am a python developer with 3 years of experience. Currently I'm working on ....... project using ...... tools. In the free time I like to do gardening.



### **1. Tell me about yourself**

I am Ashish Bindra, a Python developer with around 2.10 years of experience in building AI/ML projects, REST APIs, and web applications. I have strong expertise in Python, FastAPI, and MongoDB, and I’ve also worked with YOLO-based invoice translation and OCR projects. Alongside backend development, I also ensure clean, efficient, and scalable code with a focus on performance.

### **2. Why do you want to switch the company? / Why do you want to join our company?**

I am looking for new opportunities where I can work on challenging projects, enhance my technical skills, and contribute to impactful solutions. I’m particularly interested in your company because of the innovative projects, collaborative culture, and the scope for professional growth.

---

### **3. What are your expectations for salary? / Is expected salary negotiable?**

I am looking for a fair package that matches my skills, experience, and industry standards. However, I am flexible and open to negotiation if there is good learning and growth opportunity.

---

### **4. What kind of frameworks and tools have you used so far?**

I have mainly worked with **FastAPI**, **Flask**, and a bit of **Django** for web and API development. For databases, I’ve used **MongoDB (NoSQL)** and **MySQL/PostgreSQL (SQL)**. I have also used **YOLO for object detection**, **OpenCV**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy** for data handling, and **PyTest** for testing.

---

### **5. How many projects have you done? Explain current project.**

I have worked on multiple projects, around 4–5 in total. Currently, I am working on an **Invoice Translation System**. The project detects fields like invoice number, description, and dates using **YOLO models** and OCR, then translates them into formats compatible with Indian accounting systems. It uses **FastAPI** for REST APIs and **MongoDB** for storing document data.

---

### **6. Have you worked on SQL and No-SQL databases? Explain.**

Yes, I have worked on both.

* **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL):** I used it where data is structured and relationships between tables are important, like user management and transactional records.
* **NoSQL (MongoDB):** I used it where data is document-based, flexible, and schema-less, especially for invoices and OCR results.

---

### **7. What do you mean by security, scalability, and robustness?**

* **Security:** Protecting the application and data from unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and attacks. For example, JWT authentication, data encryption, and validation.
* **Scalability:** The ability of an application to handle an increasing load (users, data, or traffic) without performance issues.
* **Robustness:** The ability of the system to perform reliably under different conditions, including handling errors gracefully and avoiding crashes.


Q.Can you explain the role of FastAPI in your projects, particularly in the chatbot application you developed?
FastAPI plays a crucial role in my projects, especially in the chatbot application I developed. FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+, based on standard Python type hints. It is particularly known for its speed, ease of use, and automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation. In my chatbot project, I utilized FastAPI to create a robust backend API that served as the backbone for my application. It allowed me to handle requests efficiently and offered asynchronous capabilities, which improved the performance of my application significantly. I structured the API endpoints to facilitate various functionalities, such as fetching and updating NLU data, training models, and managing the chatbot's state. The use of FastAPI’s dependency injection system helped me to manage resources effectively, leading to clean and maintainable code. Furthermore, its automatic JSON serialization and validation features saved me a lot of time and effort, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and server was both structured and valid. In the context of the chatbot, I utilized FastAPI to combine various machine learning and NLP resources, such as Rasa, enabling the bot to understand user intents effectively. I implemented the training workflow through API calls, allowing admin users to train models directly from the dashboard with minimal friction. Additionally, deploying the chatbot project with Docker-compose further enhanced its reliability and portability, ensuring that all dependencies were encapsulated within a consistent environment. Overall, FastAPI allowed me to develop an efficient, high-performance, and scalable application that met the project requirements effectively.
