# Docker

## What is docker

Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share and run container applications.

## Why do we need dockers?

### **Consistency Across Environments**

- **Problem:** Applications often behave differently in development, testing, and production environments due to variations in configurations, dependencies, and infrastructure.
- **Solution:** Docker containers encapsulate all the necessary components, ensuring the
application runs consistently across all environments.

### Isolation

- **Problem:** Running multiple applications on the same host can lead to conflicts, such as
dependency clashes or resource contention.
- **Solution:** Docker provides isolated environments for each application, preventing
interference and ensuring stable performance.

### Scalability

- Problem: Scaling applications to handle increased load can be challenging, requiring
manual intervention and configuration.
- Solution: Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple
container instances, allowing for quick and efficient scaling.

Docker Engine
Docker Engine is the core component of the Docker platform, responsible for creating,
running, and managing Docker containers. It serves as the runtime that powers Docker's
containerization capabilities. Hereâ€™s an in-depth look at the Docker Engine:
